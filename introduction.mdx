# Accessing the API

We offer two types of API keys:

- **Production API Key**: Used for live, real-world applications with higher rate limits.
- **Sandbox API Key**: Used for development and testing purposes with lower rate limits and a 4-week expiration period.

To obtain a Production API key, you must log in to the [ParDocs Console](https://www.pardocs.com) and [Create a new API key](https://www.pardocs.com/api-keys).

To obtain a Sandbox API key, please contact us directly on [Discord](https://discord.gg/xgEXkh7Rxk). We will assist you in setting up the appropriate access based on your needs.
